<p>Apologies for the late post! April just mudslid into May before I knew it. <a href="https://gist.github.com/tyrostone/3b2201217571debc92b823e094c60fb6">Here</a> is the link to Laura’s gist detailing how to set up your own Shiny server on AWS.</p>
<p>If you’d like to follow along with the workshop, please create an AWS account ahead of time. Creating an account is free <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free/">(https://aws.amazon.com/free/)</a>, and includes a free trial of the features Laura demoed.</p>
<p>A lot of the content was buttressed with verbal explanations, with the gist itself being very technically detailed - so you may want to set aside time to google what certain commands mean, or to sit down with a friend or coworker who is more familiar with AWS.</p>
<p>Finally, Laura sent out some instructions for shutting your instance down if you’re done with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember to stop or terminate your instance, as well as handle the EBS volume you created (your “storage”).</p>
<p>Stop/Terminate Your Instance<br />
1. Navigate to the EC2 home screen (Services dropdown –&gt; EC2)<br />
2. Click either “Running Instances” in the middle of your screen OR “Instances” on your left-hand dashboard<br />
3. Select your instance in the table<br />
4. Select Actions –&gt; Instance State –&gt; Stop/Terminate (in the Actions dropdown)</p>
<p>Delete Your EBS Volume<br />
1. From the EC2 home screen (or other EC2 page), select “Volumes” on the left-hand dashboard<br />
2. Select your volume<br />
3. Select Actions –&gt; Delete Volumes (in the Actions dropdown)</p>
