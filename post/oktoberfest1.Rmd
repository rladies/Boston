With generous help from others, I have identified three datasets which may appear at R-Ladies Boston's OktobRfest (format TBD).

* [US Beer Statistics from TTB (R package by R-Lady Jasmine Dumas)](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ttbbeer/index.html)
* [Consumption Stats from Munich Oktoberfest](https://www.opengov-muenchen.de/dataset/oktoberfest/resource/e0f664cf-6dd9-4743-bd2b-81a8b18bd1d2) [h/t Gresch](https://gresch.github.io/2017/01/17/201701oktoberfest1985-2015/)
* [Beer Advocate Reviews, courtesy of TCB Analytics (link at bottom)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-hire-test-data-skills-one-size-fits-all-interview-tanya-cashorali)

Please send other suggestions [(\@RLadiesBoston)](https://twitter.com/RLadiesBoston), and feel free to pass these along! I'm also taking suggestions for bars in Boston with projectors to show Shiny Dashboards on ;)
